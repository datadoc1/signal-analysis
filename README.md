# Residency Signal Analysis Project

This repository contains all scripts and data used for our research project exploring the impact of residency application signals on interview outcomes across various medical specialties. Our goal is to expand on preliminary analyses by studying how signals affect interview rates, with a focus on comparing in-state versus out-of-state applicants, and various other factors.

## Project Overview

Residency signals were introduced to help applicants express special interest in certain programs during the application process. Initially rolled out in the 2022-2023 cycle for a few specialties like Orthopedics, signals have now been expanded across many fields. This project uses statistical analysis and Monte Carlo simulations to explore several aspects of the signal system, including:

- **How signals impact interview rates.**
- **Comparing success rates of applicants from different states.**
- **Understanding how optimal signal placement can improve match outcomes.**

Each specialty has its own unique dynamics, and this project aims to generate insights across various medical fields.

## Current Focus Areas
1. **Statistical Breakdown:**
* Analysis of residency interview odds based on variables such as signal placement, applicant residency (in-state vs. out-of-state), medical degree (MD, DO), and IMG status.
  
2. **Monte Carlo Simulations:**
* Simulation of interview outcomes based on different signaling strategies, with a specific focus on comparing optimal signaling to random signaling.
  
3. **Geographical Biases**
* Analysis of interview outcomes based on different states of residence. Which states give in-state students the largest edge?


## How to Access and Use the Data

## Tools and Resources

We are using **Zotero** for citation management and **SciSpace/Elicit** for exploring relevant academic papers. Please ensure that all manuscripts are properly cited and that literature reviews are thorough and up-to-date.

## Contact

If you have any questions or need additional resources, feel free to reach out directly. All coding tasks are handled separately, and I will continue updating scripts as needed for each specialty.
