Simulation Results:
-------------------
We randomly picked 6 Gold Signal rows and 6 Silver Signal rows from the dataset.

This was repeated 10,000 times to calculate the average number of interviews one should expect if they were a completely average applicant with completely randomly selected signals.

Gold Signal Sum (6): 2.72 (95% CI: 1.14-4.23)
Silver Signal Sum (6): 2.11 (95% CI: 0.82-3.41)
Total Signal Sum (12): 4.83 (95% CI: 2.81-6.78)
