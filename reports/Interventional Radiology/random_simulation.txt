Simulation Results:
-------------------
We randomly picked 6 Gold Signal rows and 6 Silver Signal rows from the dataset.

This was repeated 10,000 times to calculate the average number of interviews one should expect if they were a completely average applicant with completely randomly selected signals.

Gold Signal Sum (6): 2.7 (95% CI: 1.13-4.24)
Silver Signal Sum (6): 2.12 (95% CI: 0.81-3.45)
Total Signal Sum (12): 4.82 (95% CI: 2.83-6.81)
