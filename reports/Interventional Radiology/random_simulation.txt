Simulation Results:
-------------------
We randomly picked 6 Gold Signal rows and 6 Silver Signal rows from the dataset.

This was repeated 10,000 times to calculate the average number of interviews one should expect if they were a completely average applicant with completely randomly selected signals.

Gold Signal Sum (6): 2.71 (95% CI: 1.11-4.28)
Silver Signal Sum (6): 2.11 (95% CI: 0.79-3.42)
Total Signal Sum (12): 4.82 (95% CI: 2.78-6.82)
