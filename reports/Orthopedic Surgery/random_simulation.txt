Simulation Results:
-------------------
We randomly picked 30 programs from the dataset to signal.

This was repeated 10,000 times to calculate the average number of interviews one should expect if they were a completely average applicant with completely randomly selected signals.

Signal Sum (30): 4.63 (95% CI: 3.4-5.9)
