Simulation Results:
-------------------
We randomly picked 3 programs from the dataset to signal.

This was repeated 10,000 times to calculate the average number of interviews one should expect if they were a completely average applicant with completely randomly selected signals.

Signal Sum (3): 1.21 (95% CI: 0.19-2.23)
