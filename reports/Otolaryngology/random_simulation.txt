Simulation Results:
-------------------
We randomly picked 25 programs from the dataset to signal.

This was repeated 10,000 times to calculate the average number of interviews one should expect if they were a completely average applicant with completely randomly selected signals.

Signal Sum (25): 6.39 (95% CI: 4.46-8.31)
