Simulation Results:
-------------------
We randomly picked 6 Gold Signal rows and 6 Silver Signal rows from the dataset.

This was repeated 10,000 times to calculate the average number of interviews one should expect if they were a completely average applicant with completely randomly selected signals.

Gold Signal Sum (6): 2.7 (95% CI: 1.39-3.94)
Silver Signal Sum (6): 1.99 (95% CI: 0.95-3.01)
Total Signal Sum (12): 4.7 (95% CI: 3.06-6.29)
