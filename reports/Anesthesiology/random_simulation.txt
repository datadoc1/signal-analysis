Simulation Results:
-------------------
We randomly picked 5 Gold Signal rows and 10 Silver Signal rows from the dataset.

This was repeated 10,000 times to calculate the average number of interviews one should expect if they were a completely average applicant with completely randomly selected signals.

Gold Signal Sum (5): 2.32 (95% CI: 1.21-3.34)
Silver Signal Sum (10): 2.7 (95% CI: 1.62-3.89)
Total Signal Sum (15): 5.02 (95% CI: 3.49-6.58)
