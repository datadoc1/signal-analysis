Simulation Results:
-------------------
We randomly picked 5 Gold Signal rows and 10 Silver Signal rows from the dataset.

This was repeated 10,000 times to calculate the average number of interviews one should expect if they were a completely average applicant with completely randomly selected signals.

Gold Signal Sum (5): 2.33 (95% CI: 1.22-3.32)
Silver Signal Sum (10): 2.7 (95% CI: 1.64-3.87)
Total Signal Sum (15): 5.03 (95% CI: 3.51-6.56)
