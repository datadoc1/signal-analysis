Simulation Results:
-------------------
We randomly picked 3 Gold Signal rows and 25 Silver Signal rows from the dataset.

This was repeated 10,000 times to calculate the average number of interviews one should expect if they were a completely average applicant with completely randomly selected signals.

Gold Signal Sum (3): 1.1 (95% CI: 0.0-2.11)
Silver Signal Sum (25): 2.63 (95% CI: 1.83-3.52)
Total Signal Sum (28): 3.73 (95% CI: 2.43-5.05)
