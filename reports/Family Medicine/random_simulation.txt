Simulation Results:
-------------------
We randomly picked 5 programs from the dataset to signal.

This was repeated 10,000 times to calculate the average number of interviews one should expect if they were a completely average applicant with completely randomly selected signals.

Signal Sum (5): 1.75 (95% CI: 0.69-2.84)
